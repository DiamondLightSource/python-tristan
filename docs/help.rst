Every command in the tristan package has a help message that explains its usage and shows a list of accepted
positional and optional arguments.
The help message is printed by passing the option --help, alias -h, to any of the commands.

.. code-block:: console

    images multi -h

Or,

.. code-block:: console

    find-trigger-intervals --help
