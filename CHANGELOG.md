# CHANGES

## 0.2.0
- All the `images` tools have had an overhaul and should now be much more robust, even when binning large numbers of events to large numbers of images. 

## 0.1.17
- You can now launch any of the `images` commands with the `<file-name>.nxs` file as valid input, as an alternative to the `<file-name>_meta.h5` file.

## 0.1.16
- Added diagnostic tools `check-tristan-files` for checking that all files from all detector modules contain valid data, and `find-trigger-intervals` for discovering the intervals between related cue messages.
